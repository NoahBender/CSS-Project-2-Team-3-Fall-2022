    "\n",
    "Bias and variance denote two kinds of error which exist in an inverse relationship to one another. In other words, correcting for one unavoidably exacerbates the other, at least in the social sciences. When fitting a model, therefore, it is impossible to do away with bias and variance; instead, one must trade them off against one another to achieve the optimal fit and thus maximize predictive power. A model that incorporates excessive variance is said to be overfit. Conversely a model that is too biased will appear underfit. In either case the predictive power of the model will be poor. In machine learning applications, striking the right balance between bias and variance usually entails trial and error through the creation of different models and the tweaking of hyperparameters. Our analysis employed three types of regression and five distinct models to locate the most robust predictive algorithm. \n",
    "\n",
    "6.2 Define overfitting, and why it matters for machine\n",
    "learning. How can we address it?\n",
    "\n",
    "An \"overfit\" model is one which incorporates too much of the natural variance found in the training data. At first glance, an overfit model may appear robust, but it will perform poorly when evaluated on the test set. Because computational machine learning algorithms can fit data perfectly, the risk of overfitting is significant. For this reason, techniques designed to mitigate overfitting are crucial to almost any machine learning workflow. Concretely, this means introducing bias into the statistical model through techniques like the Lasso and Ridge regression, which effectively filter out noise in the data. \n",

    "*Region*: Pockets of high diabetes incidence can be found across the United States, but the situation in Appalachia and the Deep South stands out both for the rate of diagnosis and the number of counties afflicted. Whereas many states contain a handful of severely affected counties, states like West Virginia and Mississippi are in the throes of a diabetes epidemic, compounded by high rates of obesity and physical inactivity. Any government program to contain the spread of diabetes should begin in these regions.  \n",
    "*Age and Sex*: Age is a significant factor in diabetes, obesity, and physical inactivity. The data showed that all of three diagnostics was correlated with age. In particular, when looking at the population proportion of 65 years and over for male and female, male shows stronger correlation with these diagnostics. Although the casual reason cannot be identified, there might be socioeconomic factors not just biological differences. Further research needs to be done for possible interventions.  \n",
    "*Real World Application*: Applying this method is suitable especially for promoting policy making based on data. However, we must recognize that the numbers here does not depict everything and might miss out factors outside the available data. It should be recognized that elements outside the data could be a critical factor which is not assessed here and the implication must be treated with caution.\n",
